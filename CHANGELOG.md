### Patch Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/code-inbox/code-inbox/pull/10) [`63fe024`](https://github.com/code-inbox/code-inbox/commit/63fe02469d71e5f668e68913a134d6d56f005fcb) Thanks [@smeijer](https://github.com/smeijer)! - Added changesets to the repo, so we have a nice way to maintain changelogs and
  automatically publish new versions to the marketplace, without publishing every
  single commit.

  Changesets should be included in every pull request. Run `changeset` in the root
  of this project to create a markdown file using an interactive guide.
